SECTION 5.6 SUMMARY Monopolistic competition is 'imperfect competition among the many' . Monopolistic competition resembles perfect competition in that abnormal profits can be made in the short run but not in the long run: j In the long run, the entry of new firms competes away abnormal profits_ Monopolistic competition resembles monopoly in that each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve (and AR curve): In the long run, firms in monopolistic competition are allocatively efficient; but not productively efficient: However; consumers benefit from the choice offered by a large number of firms selling slightly differentiated products. 5.7 Oligopoly The meaning of oligopoly The prefix *oligo-' attached to a word is taken from the Greek oligos, meaning few: In a literal sense, therefore an oligopoly is a market industry containing a few firms This is the way oligopoly is defined as a form of market structure. However; there is a problem with this method of definition. How many or how few firms should there be for oligopoly to exist? Do 10 firms make up an oligopoly but 1l firms do not? And what about a market in which there are, say, seven very large firms, but also scores Or even hundreds of small firms? Market structure and concentration ratios As we have just noted, oligopoly can be defined in terms of market structure and a limited number of firms in a market. We will look at how concentration ratios are used to identify oligopoly in highly concentrated market structures_ concentration ratio can provide a indicator ofan oligopolistic market structure. For example, a five-firm Barclays 25% HSBC concentration ratio shows the percentage or share of output in 30% an industry produced by the five largest firms in the industry: Figure 5.14 enables us to calculate the five-firm concentration ratio among the six largest banks in the UK banking industry reported in 2021. The five-firm concentration ratio was 94%, though we should note that many other smaller UK banks such as Metro Bank and the Co-operative Bank are not 4% 17% Virgin Money Lloyds included in the data. 145 10% 12% Nationwide NatWest* KEY TERM concentration ratio measures the market share #NatWest is subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group.

Oligopoly and market behaviour As already mentioned, oligopoly is best defined_ not only by market structure KEY TERM or the number of firms in the market, but also by market conduct, or the j market conduct the pricing behaviour ofthe firms within the market. An oligopolistic firm affects its rivals marb cketing policies through its and output decisions, bul its own prolit can also be allected pursued by firms This is also by how rivals behave and react to the firm s decisions. Suppose, for example, known as market behaviour; the firm reduces its in order t0 increase market share and boost but is not to be confused with market performance, which Whether the reduction increases reduces the firms depends on refers to the end results of the reactions of the other firms_ these policies_ Interdependence and uncertainty in oligopoly Competitive oligopoly exists when the rival firms are interdependent in the sense that must take account of each others reactions when forming a TEST YOURSELF 5.14 market strategy; but independent in the sense thal decide their market What is the difference between strategies without cooperation or collusion As a result; uncertainty is a market structure and market characteristic of competitive oligopoly; a firm can never be completely certain conduct? of how rivals will react t0 its price, marketing and oulput strategy: Il the lirm raises its price, will the rivals follow suit or will they hold their steady in the of gaining sales and market share? Non-collusive oligopoly, collusive oligopoly and cartels As we noted in the previous paragraph, in competitive oligopoly, firms act independently in the sense that do not form agreements with each other: This is also known as non-collusive Members of the cartel oligopoly: The uncertainty competitive oligopolists can be reduced and perhaps eliminated by the rival firms colluding together Firm Ficm Firm Firm Firm for example; by forming a cartel 0r ring: In Figure 5.15 , live lirms jointly agree t0 charge a keep Firm E, which is the Least productively least efficient firm; in the market.

Nevertheless_ some lorms of cooperalion or collusion between oligopolistic lirms may be justiliable and in the public interest; These include joint product development (such as the Ford Fiesta and Mazda 2 cars, both built using many shared components between 1974 and 2015) , and cooperation to improve health and within an industry or to ensure that product and labour standards are maintained. Such examples ol industry collaboration , or overl collusion, which is in full public view, are normally deemed t0 be in contrasl l0 collusion, which is regardedl as bad. Price collusion and other markel-rigging agreements almost always take place in seerel. This is covert collusion.

In order to anticipate how sales might change following a P3 change, firms need to know the position and shape of the demand and revenue curves [or their products But in imperlectly compelitive markels firms lack accurate information about these curves, particularly at outputs signilicantly dillerent Irom those currently produced. This means that the demand curve or AR curve in Figure 5.17 is not necessarily the correct Or D =AR actual demand curve lor the oligopolist s output Instead, it represents the firms Q3 Output estimale of how demand changes when the firm changes the it is charging: Figure 5.17 The kinked demand curve When increasing price Pi to Pz, the oligopolist expects rivals to react by keeping their own stable and not following suit. By holding their steady, rivals try t0 and market share at the lirm's expense This means that the oligopolist expects demand to be relatively elastic in response L0 a increase. The rise in [rom P1 to Pz is likely to result in a more than proportionate fall in demand Q1 t0 Q2. Conversely; when cutting its price Irom P to P3, the oligopolist expects rivals t0 react in a very dillerent way, namely by following suit immedliately with a malching cUl; In this situation, because the markel demand curve lor the proclucts of all the lirms slopes downwards, each lirm will benelit Irom some increase in demand. However; the oligopolist lails to gain sales Irom rivals within the market: This means the oligopolist expects demand to be less elastic, and probably inelastic, in response to a cul. The fall in From Pi t0 Pz may 149 result in a less than proportionate increase in demand from Q1 t0 Q3. The oligopolist therelore expects rivals L0 reacl asymmelrically when is raised or lowered.

As Figure 5.18 illustrates_ firm's product at different prices_ Nevertheless_ mathematical discontinuity exists along the vertical the oligopolist's selling price remains stable at P1 line above output Q1. For the demand and as as marginal cost curve lies between average revenue curves, the discontinuity occurs MCz and MC3, despite quite considerable changes in at the 'kink' where the curves intersect. But for the marginal costs marginal revenue curves, which are twice as steep Price as the AR curves with which they are associated, the MCz 1 discontinuity is the 'gap' between the two MR curves MCI shown by the distance 8 to C MC3 Suppose initially the firm's marginal cost curve is 2 MCI, intersecting the MR curve at point A, which is positioned in the middle of the vertical section. The diagram shows that the MC curve can rise or fall AR 6 within the vertical section of the MR curve, without altering the profit-maximising output Q1 or price MR P1: But if marginal costs rise above MCz at Output fall below MC3 at C,the profit-maximising 1I output changes. In either of these circumstances, Figure 5.18 Developing the theory the oligopolist would have to set a different price of the kinked demand curve 8 Criticisms of the kinked demand curve theory There are & number o[ weaknesses in the theory we have just described. 1 Although at first sight it is attractive as a neal and apparently plausible explanation of stability in conditions of oligopoly, few economists now accepl the kinked demand theory ol oligopoly pricing; First; it is an incomplete theory; since it does not explain how and why a lirm chooses in the lirst place lo be at point X in Figure 5.17.
